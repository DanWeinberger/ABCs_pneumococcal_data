# ABCs_pneumococcal_data

Collection of publicly available data from the CDC's active bacterial Core Surveillance system for invasive pneumococcal disease. 
This includes sequenced isolates, which are not 100% of the cases. Note that catchment populations change over time so trends cannot be 
inferred without accurate denominators.

Also includes data from the ECDC surveillance atlas
